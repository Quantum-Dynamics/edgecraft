## edgecraft

# This simulator closely follows the work of Hotta, et al., 2022.
# In this project, we simulate a quantum hall edge expansion and attempt to find voltages that we may apply to a semiconductor to attain a given scale factor.
# We know from Hotta, et al., 2022 that the scale factor influences much of the dynamics of a system. We can create scale factors that match well-known models of an expanding universe and attempt to measure their results. In this way, we hope to find Hawking radiation and many more phenomenon.
